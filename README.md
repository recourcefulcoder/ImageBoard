# NodeStory

This app is an online web-site for communal storywriting.

The main idea is to build an app where each story can from each place be 
continued by community writers, thus creating variable developments for the 
main plot. Each part of the story (e.i. "node") is graded by users, providing 
an opportunity for the best narration to pop up on the top of each story.
